# AltspaceVR Web SDK

This SDK can be used with [three.js] to create holographic, multi-user web apps for virtual reality. When running inside AltspaceVR they can be experienced with consumer VR hardware including the Oculus Rift DK2.

Three.js is an open-source, render-agnostic 3D engine written in Javascript. It is used to construct much of the 3D graphics you see on the web, and can be used to create entire applications, or enhance existing webpages with 3D content.

This repository contains the primary documentation for the SDK and related APIs, as well as examples and helper modules. As  all required APIs are already integrated into the client, you can build holographic three.js apps for AltspaceVR without using additional libraries from this repo (though many many can be very useful). 

This SDK is in pre-release beta and actively under development. **It is critically important to stay up to date by reading the [Wiki], the [Developer Answers] page, and the [GitHub Issues] page.**

> **Heads up that some documentation and examples may be out of date.** AltRenderer has been depreciated, and altspace.getThreeJSRenderer() should be used instead. All window.Alt calls have been depreciated and replaced with calls on window.altspace, and all supported AltspaceVR APIs now exist only on this object. AltOBJMTLLoader should not be used for any new apps.
 
## Getting Started

Start by following our [Setup Guide]

## AltspaceVR APIs

####Holographic Rendering

* `altspace.getThreeJSRenderer()`  
 returns a renderer that can be used to render three.js scenes as holographic objects

####Enclosure Properties

* `altspace.getEnclosure().then(callback)`  
 returns a promise that will fufill with a description of the enclosure, including pixelsPerMeter which can be used as a coefficient to maintain static sizes for objects regardless of the scale of the enclosure.

####User Data

* `altspace.getUser().then(callback)`  
 returns a promise that will fufill with information about the local user

####Cursor Events

The basic way to allow the user to interact with three.js objects in AltspaceVR is by attaching cursor event listeners. 

>Note that currently every mesh is represented in our physics engine as object aligned cuboids, 80% the size of a full bounding box (basically a stretched cube that contains most of the object). This means that the cursor will not precisely collide with your meshes, and that signifigantly concave objects (buckets, etc) will block contained objects from being clicked on.

* `mesh.addEventListener('cursorup' / 'cursordown', callback);`  
 listen for cursor events on a specific object.
* `scene.addEventListner('cursormove', callback)`  
 listen for cursor move events

####Tracking Skeleton

* `altspace.getThreeJSTrackingSkeleton().then(callback)`  
 returns a promise that will fufill with a three.js object hierarchy with each object representing a joint in the unified tracking skeleton. These object's transforms will be automatically updated by AltspaceVR

## Three.js Feature Support

**Currently supported:**
* Object3D transformation and hierarchy
* Most Geometries
* MeshBasicMaterial map and color properties
* Examples: [Draggable Cubes] - [Voxel Painter] - [Falling Cubes] - [Flocking Birds] - [OBJ/MTL Import]

**Not currently supported:**
* Lighting, custom shaders, screen space effects.
* Examples: [Hemisphere Light] - [Material Reflection] - [Ocean Shader]

**Habits of Successful AltspaceVR Web Apps:**
* Use Object3D transforms (position, rotation, scale) for animation rather than skinned meshes.
* Get user input via AltspaceVR cursor events or the tracking skeleton rather than from the keyboard.
* Limit the number of objects per scene and polygons per object.
* Bake ambient occlusion and other lighting into your models. All models currently render as unlit.
