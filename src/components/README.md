## A-Frame API for AltspaceVR

When it comes to building something quick in AltspaceVR, it’s hard to beat [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). It has a simple HTML-based syntax, so anyone acquainted with web development will pick it up in no time. On the other hand, if you don’t know what an HTML tag is, or how to add an image to a page, you should go through MDN’s terrific [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction) before you continue.

The world is full of web developers, so if you consider yourself one of them, and feel comfortable experimenting on your own, you should jump right in with the [A-Frame Documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/). You just need to add the `altspace` component to your `<a-scene>` tag. Keep in mind though that development in AltspaceVR has a few [caveats](../).

In either case, you should join the [AltspaceVR SDK Slack channel](https://developer.altvr.com/slack)! We love to see what you’re working on, and are always happy to answer questions. In addition, there are special activities available only for developers that may be better for apps. Just request developer status on Slack, and we’ll hook you up!

## Quick Start

This is a fully functional example of what A-Frame code looks like.

            var rgb = [
                Math.floor(Math.random()*255),
                Math.floor(Math.random()*255),
                Math.floor(Math.random()*255)
            ];
            self.el.setAttribute('color', 'rgb('+rgb.join(',')+')');
        });
    }
});

<body>

<!-- set up the scene -->
<a-scene altspace='vertical-align: bottom;'>
    <a-box position='0 1 0' color-cycle></a-box>
</a-scene>

</body></html>
```

## Native Components

In addition to the normal power of A-Frame that AltspaceVR developers are used to, we now support attaching native AltspaceVR assets to entities via special A-Frame components. So you can spawn physical objects that you can stand on, interactables that users can pick up and throw, and much more! The downside here is that this process is opaque to your code. For example, if you attach an object to a user via `n-skeleton-parent`, its true position in Javascript is not updated, even though it moves around the scene. See the [native component documentation](module-altspace_components.html) and the [native component FAQ](https://github.com/AltspaceVR/aframe-altspace-component/blob/master/native.md) for the details.


## Native Resources

One of the biggest challenges in creating VR applications is gathering and optimizing art and sound content. We've gone ahead and built a bunch of resources to get you started! They can be invoked via the [n-object](module-altspace_components.n-object.html), [n-sound](module-altspace_components.n-sound.html), and [n-spawner](module-altspace_components.n-spawner.html) native components and are automatically optimized for the individual platform your user happens to be on. See the [resource list](module-altspace_resources.html) for the complete list of resources available.
